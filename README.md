# Fusion Sample - Final

This project includes:
- Backend ASP.NET Core API with JWT, EF Core (SQLite), Middleware, DI, Swagger
- React frontend (Vite) and Blazor WebAssembly client calling the same API
- Unit tests (xUnit) for service and controller layer
- Instructions to publish Blazor into API wwwroot so API serves it directly
